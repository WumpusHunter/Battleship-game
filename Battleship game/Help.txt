 Rules from the classic Russian version:
1. Locate your fleet on your grid in such a way that the
ships don't overlap each other or go consecutive using
their sides or angles. In our case, this is done randomly.
2. Decide with the opposite player who is to shot first.
In our case, at the start of the game you shoot first, then
the first shots the one who won the previous game.
3. Start to alternate shots with the opposite player until
one of you won't sink the entire target fleet. The one who
did it first wins. The one who had a "hit" continue shooting;
the one who had a "miss" passes the turn to shot to the
opposite player.
 Fleet from the classic Russian version:
Number	Kind of ship	Size
1	Battleship	4
2	Cruiser		3
3	Destroyer	2
4	Torpedo boat	1
 The usual grid from the classic Russian version is a 10x10
grid of squares.
