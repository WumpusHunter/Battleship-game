  Cases to handle with the random location:
1) Ships are inside the given frame
2) Ships are not overlapped by each other
3) Cells of the ships are at the same positions as cells of the given frame

  Tests (the first is a fleet):
1.1 ({ 0, 0 }, 1000, 1000, 100, 100)
1.2 ({ 250, 500 }, 500, 250, 50, 25)
1.3 ({ 500, 250 }, 250, 500, 25, 50)
